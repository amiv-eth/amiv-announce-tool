Amiv announce tool is a tool made to create and edit the amiv announce email which is sent to all signed-up students every once in a while.
The file selector.html and ./js/events.js implement the sorting and selecting functionality needed to edit the announce letter based on jQuery, pulling the required data from AMIV API.
The announce letter then is built using the mustache framework and template files.
